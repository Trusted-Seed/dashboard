    question: How do I join the Trusted Seed?
  - answer: >-
      Entire organizations are not able to apply to the Trusted Seed at this
      time. It is outside the scope of coverage the Swiss Membership can
      provide.


      However, a single individual representing their organization may apply as a Trusted Seed Ambassador. This Ambassador will hold a TRUST Score, and be charged to stay relatively up-to-date on the happenings in the Commons Stack ecosystem. Only the Ambassador will be eligible for the legal protection of the Trusted Seed Swiss Membership.
    question: Can my organization apply to the Trusted Seed?
  - answer: The legal structure of the Trusted Seed is designed for the most
      litigious legal environments (for example, within the United States). It
      is designed to protect its members from potential legal situations that
      could arise from normal good faith actions within DAOs and Commons that
      are often considered general partnerships with potential legal liability
      for individuals.
    question: What are the legal implications of joining the Trusted Seed within my
      specific country?
  - answer: No. The legal structure proposed allows the membership to be treated in
      a similar manner as a membership at your local gym. There should be no
      reporting requirements but it is always a good idea to stay informed of
      regulatory changes within your local and national jurisdictions.
    question: Do I have to report to anyone in my country that I am a member of this
      association?
  - answer: The rules are located in our [Terms &
      Conditions](https://ipfs.web3.party/ipfs/QmYDmtmDYUPR6wjukzaNytibeNnYs41s2co4tNzkUYdd5n)
      that members must agree to before joining the Swiss Association. In
      summary, if you act in good faith and do not perform any intentionally
      illegal actions, you should remain eligible for legal protection.
    question: Is it clear where I have breached the Terms & Conditions?
  - answer: There is not a defined list, but all good faith participation in
      approved DAOs will generally be covered.
    question: Is there a list of what will be covered by the Legal protections?
  - answer: The Trusted Seed doesn't remove any liabilities. Unfortunately, if you
      hold tokens in a DAO or Commons, in many jurisdictions you can be held
      100% individually liable for any actions made by the DAO. However, if you
      are a Member of our Trusted Seed, and you were acting in good faith as a
      member of a qualified DAO, we will fight for you! We will contribute to
      your legal defense and rally support from the greater community.
    question: What liabilities are removed by the legal protection of the Swiss
      Association?
  - answer: To operate in ‘the real world’, only legal entities can limit liability.
    question: Why is the Swiss Association a legal entity?
  - answer: >-
      * Avoids ‘general partnership’ designation

      * Simple constitutional requirements

      * Members rather than investors

      * Open to anyone from anywhere

      * Satisfies [minimum viable centralisation](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-minimum-viable-centralization-a55e3685f7a2)

      * Read the [Swiss Association T&C’s](https://ipfs.web3.party/ipfs/QmYDmtmDYUPR6wjukzaNytibeNnYs41s2co4tNzkUYdd5n) & [Statutes](https://ipfs.web3.party/ipfs/QmcGNi9dcVgLJGtxJzjU2CyrrmVKkLnNPEK8JJC2a98zC5)
    question: Why is the Trusted Seed a Swiss Association?
scoreFAQ:
  - question: What is $TRUST?
    answer: TRUST score ($TRUST), formerly CSTK score. The name has changed but
      everything works the same. It is still a non-transferrable reputation
      token that represents the “skin in the game” that value-driven members of
      the blockchain community have put towards advancing Commons Stack’s
      mission. Like $CSTK, $TRUST is on Gnosis Chain.
  - answer: >-
      * $TRUST are native to the xDAI EVM chain, and we highly recommend storage
      on [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

      * Smart contract wallets like DAO multi-sigs on Gnosis or Aragon are less compatible for cross-chain operations.

      * [Here’s a primer](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup) on how to set up Metamask to work on the xDAI network

      * Remember, if worse comes to worst and your tokens become locked or unusable somehow: The Trusted Seed can always burn your old score and issue you new ones since we are centralized arbiters of the $TRUST!
    question: How should I store my $TRUST?
  - answer: >-
      Anyone holding $TRUST is a member of our Trusted Seed, a highly curated
      list of reputable & experienced community members who are aligned with our
      mission of creating sustainable funding for public goods using token
      engineering and commons management best practices.


      * Participate in governance decisions and the Hatch of upcoming Commons!

      * Participate in ranking grants for matching funds via the Commons Stack Panvala League (on [cv.commonsstack.org](http://cv.commonsstack.org/)) Over $175,000 in $PAN matching allocated throughout 2020-2021!

      * Help steward resources and decision making for mission aligned projects

      * Get TSLove tokens, which get you free Commons Stack swag from our store! (<https://swag.trustedseed.org/>[](http://cslove.commonsstack.org/))
