      the TEC. We have expanded beyond that to support the initialization of
      Giveth and Ixo, and expect our members to be invited to many other early

  - description: "Beyond just being a safe community to include in the launch of
      your Impact DAO, we also support our members in the case they have legal
      issues while acting in good faith within a qualifying DAO. Under the hood,
      the Trusted Seed is a legal mutual aid group. "
