      the TEC. We have expanded beyond that to support the initialization of
      Giveth and Ixo, and expect our members to be invited to many other early
      stage Regen Economies.

      Beyond just being a safe community to include in the launch of your Impact
      DAO, we also support our members in the case they have legal issues while
      acting in good faith within a qualifying DAO. Under the hood, Trusted Seed
      is a legal mutual aid group. 


      Beyond just being a safe community to include in the launch of your Impact DAO, we also support our members in the case they have legal issues while acting in good faith within a qualifying DAO. Under the hood, Trusted Seed is a legal mutual aid group. If one of us has a legal issue, we will band together to support this member in their fight for their right to DAO. Our organization strives to ensure that experimentation in building a better world can be done with a safety net. We are that net.
