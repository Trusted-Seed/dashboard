  - description: The Trusted Seed is a cultural initialization tool for
      [Regenerative
      Economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_economic_theory),
      stacking their DAOs with a trusted group of curated regen members who can
      help create and steward sustainable economies, as opposed to degen airdrop
      hunters.

      Association with the mandate to provide mutual aid to members who are in a
      sticky legal situation with any of our Qualifying DAOs, subject to terms

      Stackâ€™s](https://commonsstack.org) mission, by [Hatching the Token
      Engineering
      Commons](https://medium.com/commonsstack/whats-in-a-hatch-3799a398243a)
      (TEC). We have expanded beyond that to support the initialization of
      Giveth and IXO, and expect our members to be invited to many other early
      stage Regen Economies.
